<p style="text-align:justify">My name is Deborah Adeola Aransiola from the northern part of Nigeria; Kwara state by origin. I immigrated to Toronto, Canada last year 2016, to better and advance my life in all-round personal and professional development. I am currently receiving training in Information Technology; Software Development and Testing precisely from Npower Canada. Npower Canada program is an Industry-certified entry-level IT skills training for youth. It consists of a minimum of 13 weeks of technical and professional development training geared toward preparing me to write certifications such as; Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA), ISTQB – International Software Testing Qualifications Board Foundation Level, and launch me into an entry-level IT career.</>


<p style="text-align:justify">Prior to this training, I am a graduate student from Covenant University in Banking and Finance, Nigeria. I graduated from the university in the year 2012, served the country during 2012-2013 National Youth Service Corp, worked as an Internal Auditor for 2 years in a Finance and e-Payment Industry, and currently developing professionally. It is important to note that I am a passionate and driven, goal and result oriented resolution and hard work professional with strong interest as a Software Developer in a dynamic IT focused environment.</p>


<p style="text-align:justify">However, sport especially soccer is a thing that must be mentioned as one of my hobbies. I love to play soccer during my free time outside watching movies, listening to music, researching being my stress coping plans. We were taught stress coping plans as a way to reduce or overcome stress. There are different kinds particular to each individual. It helps most times but if in case you try any and it doesn't work, try another and keep trying until you find the one that work best for you. Never give up, keep trying till you make it happen. "Fake it till you Make it".</p> 


<p style="text-align:justify">In conclusion, I am learning some programming language currently such as; HTML5, CSS3, Java, JavaScript, C#, ASP.NET, SQL which are pretty confusing for me right now but is understandable because am still new to the IT world. I am certain and convinced I will get it right soon and be best at it due to my driving force, "Passion".</p>
